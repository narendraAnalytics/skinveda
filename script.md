## 🌍 The Real-World Problem We Resolve

Most people struggle with three core issues in skincare:
1.  **Generic Solutions**: Over-the-counter products often ignore your unique skin type, environment, and lifestyle.
2.  **Disconnected Wellness**: We forget that skin health is deeply tied to our sleep, stress levels, and diet.
3.  **Complex Access**: Professional dermatological advice can be expensive and inaccessible.

**Skinveda resolves this** by providing an affordable, AI-driven "Live Doctor" experience in your pocket. We combine clinical skin analysis with holistic recommendations—including diet, face yoga, and Vedic meditation—to treat the root cause, not just the symptoms.

## 🚀 How It Works: Step-by-Step

Using Skinveda is a seamless journey designed to understand the "Total You." Here is how you can get started:

### 1️⃣ Onboarding & Personalization
When you first open the app, you’ll be greeted by a premium interface. Your first step is to choose your preferred **language**. Whether it's English, Hindi, Telugu, Marathi, or Kannada, Skinveda speaks your language to ensure you feel at home.

### 2️⃣ Deep Skin Profiling
You’ll enter our 7-step "Glow Guide" wizard. Here, we collect basic details like your name, age, and gender. You can even use **voice input** to speak your details—the AI will understand and fill the forms for you!

### 3️⃣ Lifestyle & Health Integration
True skin wisdom comes from understanding your habits. Skinveda asks about your skin concerns (like acne or pigmentation) and your daily wellness data. If you use a wearable device, we can sync your **sleep patterns, heart rate, and step count** to provide a more accurate analysis.

### 4️⃣ AI-Powered Vision Analysis
This is where the magic happens. You’ll be guided to capture a high-quality photo of your face using our custom camera interface. Our specialized AI (powered by Google Gemini) scans your skin for metrics like **hydration, redness, pigmentation, and fine lines**.

### 5️⃣ Your Personalized Dashboard
Once the analysis is complete, you receive a comprehensive report. This isn't just a score; it's a **Skin Wisdom Dashboard**. You'll see:
*   **Clinical Scores**: Scientific metrics of your skin health.
*   **Holistic Routine**: Personalized face yoga, meditation sessions, and dietary "Eat/Avoid" lists.

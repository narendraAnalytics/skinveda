# Audio (expo-audio)

_A library that provides an API to implement audio playback and recording in apps._

Available on platforms android, ios, web, tvos

`expo-audio` is a cross-platform audio library for accessing the native audio capabilities of the device.

Note that audio automatically stops if headphones/bluetooth audio devices are disconnected.

## Installation

```bash
$ npx expo install expo-audio
```

If you are installing this in an existing React Native app, make sure to install `expo` in your project.

## Configuration in app config

You can configure `expo-audio` using its built-in [config plugin](https://docs.expo.dev/config-plugins/introduction/) if you use config plugins in your project ([Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation/)). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect. If your app does **not** use CNG, then you'll need to manually configure the library.

```json app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-audio",
        {
          "microphonePermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your microphone."
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configurable properties
| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `microphonePermission` | `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your microphone"` | Only for: ios. A string to set the `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` permission message. Setting it to `false` will disable the permission. |
| `recordAudioAndroid` | `true` | Only for: android. A boolean that determines whether to enable the `RECORD_AUDIO` permission on Android. |
| `enableBackgroundRecording` | `false` | A boolean that determines whether to enable background audio recording. On Android, this adds foreground service permissions and displays a persistent notification during recording. On iOS, this adds the `audio` background mode. **Note:** Background recording can significantly impact battery life. |

## Usage

### Playing sounds

```jsx
import { View, StyleSheet, Button } from 'react-native';
import { useAudioPlayer } from 'expo-audio';

const audioSource = require('./assets/Hello.mp3');

export default function App() {
  const player = useAudioPlayer(audioSource);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button title="Play Sound" onPress={() => player.play()} />
      <Button
        title="Replay Sound"
        onPress={() => {
          player.seekTo(0);
          player.play();
        }}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',
    padding: 10,
  },
});
```

### Recording sounds

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, StyleSheet, Button } from 'react-native';
import {
  useAudioRecorder,
  AudioModule,
  RecordingPresets,
  setAudioModeAsync,
  useAudioRecorderState,
} from 'expo-audio';

export default function App() {
  const audioRecorder = useAudioRecorder(RecordingPresets.HIGH_QUALITY);
  const recorderState = useAudioRecorderState(audioRecorder);

  const record = async () => {
    await audioRecorder.prepareToRecordAsync();
    audioRecorder.record();
  };

  const stopRecording = async () => {
    // The recording will be available on `audioRecorder.uri`.
    await audioRecorder.stop();
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      const status = await AudioModule.requestRecordingPermissionsAsync();
      if (!status.granted) {
        Alert.alert('Permission to access microphone was denied');
      }

      setAudioModeAsync({
        playsInSilentMode: true,
        allowsRecording: true,
      });
    })();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Button
        title={recorderState.isRecording ? 'Stop Recording' : 'Start Recording'}
        onPress={recorderState.isRecording ? stopRecording : record}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#ecf0f1',
    padding: 10,
  },
});
```

### Playing audio in background&ensp;<PlatformTags platforms={['ios']} />

On iOS, audio playback and recording in background is only available in standalone apps, and it requires some extra configuration.
On iOS, each background feature requires a special key in `UIBackgroundModes` array in your **Info.plist** file.
In standalone apps this array is empty by default, so to use background features you will need to add appropriate keys to your **app.json** configuration.

See an example of **app.json** that enables audio playback in background:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    ...
    "ios": {
      ...
      "infoPlist": {
        ...
        "UIBackgroundModes": [
          "audio"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Recording audio in background

> **warning** Background recording can significantly impact battery life. Only enable it when necessary for your app's functionality.

Background audio recording allows your app to continue recording when it moves to the background or when the device screen locks.

To enable background recording, use the config plugin in your [app config](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/configuration/):

```json app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-audio",
        {
          "microphonePermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to record audio.",
          "enableBackgroundRecording": true
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

The above configuration automatically configures the required native settings:

- <PlatformTags platforms={['android']} /> Adds `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE` and
  `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permissions
- <PlatformTags platforms={['ios']} /> Adds the `audio` `UIBackgroundMode` capability

<ConfigReactNative>

If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation/)) (you're using native **android** and **ios** projects manually), then you need to configure following permissions in your native projects:

- For Android, add to **android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**:

  ```xml android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS" />
  ```

- For iOS, add to **ios/YourApp/Info.plist**:

  ```xml ios/YourApp/Info.plist
  <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
  <array>
    <string>audio</string>
  </array>
  ```

</ConfigReactNative>

#### Usage

After configuring your app, enable background recording at runtime using [`setAudioModeAsync`](#audiosetaudiomodeasyncmode):

```jsx
import { setAudioModeAsync, useAudioRecorder, RecordingPresets } from 'expo-audio';

await setAudioModeAsync({
  playsInSilentMode: true,
  allowsRecording: true,
  allowsBackgroundRecording: true,
});

const recorder = useAudioRecorder(RecordingPresets.HIGH_QUALITY);
await recorder.prepareToRecordAsync();
await recorder.record();

// Recording continues in background
```

<PlatformTags platforms={['android']} />

On Android, background recording requires a foreground service, which displays a persistent notification with the text "Recording audio" and a stop button. This notification cannot be dismissed while recording is active and automatically disappears when recording stops.

<PlatformTags platforms={['ios']} />

On iOS, background recording continues seamlessly when the app is in the background or the screen locks. No additional notifications or indicators are shown to the app user beyond the system status bar.

### Using the AudioPlayer directly

In most cases, the [`useAudioPlayer`](#useaudioplayersource-options) hook should be used to create a `AudioPlayer` instance. It manages the player's lifecycle and ensures that it is properly disposed of when the component is unmounted. However, in some advanced use cases, it might be necessary to create a `AudioPlayer` that does not get automatically destroyed when the component is unmounted.
In those cases, the `AudioPlayer` can be created using the [`createAudioPlayer`](#audiocreateaudioplayersource-options) function. You need to be aware of the risks that come with this approach, as it is your responsibility to call the [`release()`](../sdk/expo/#release) method when the player is no longer needed. If not handled properly, this approach may lead to memory leaks.

```tsx
import { createAudioPlayer } from 'expo-audio';
const player = createAudioPlayer(audioSource);
```

### Notes on web usage

- A MediaRecorder issue on Chrome produces WebM files missing the duration metadata. [See the open Chromium issue](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=642012).
- MediaRecorder encoding options and other configurations are inconsistent across browsers, utilizing a Polyfill such as [kbumsik/opus-media-recorder](https://github.com/kbumsik/opus-media-recorder) or [ai/audio-recorder-polyfill](https://github.com/ai/audio-recorder-polyfill) in your application will improve your experience. Any options passed to `prepareToRecordAsync` will be passed directly to the MediaRecorder API and as such the polyfill.
- Web browsers require sites to be served securely for them to listen to a mic. See [MediaDevices `getUserMedia()` security](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia#security) for more details.

  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `eventName` | EventName | - |
  | `listener` | indexedAccess | - |

- `clearLockScreenControls()`
  Removes this player from lock screen controls if it's currently active.
  This will clear the lock screen's now playing info.

- `emit(eventName: EventName, args: Parameters<indexedAccess>)`
  Synchronously calls all the listeners attached to that specific event.
  The event can include any number of arguments that will be passed to the listeners.
  | Parameter | Type | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |

      </View>
    );
  }
  ```

### Audio Methods

#### createAudioPlayer (*Function*)
- `createAudioPlayer(source: AudioSource, options: AudioPlayerOptions): AudioPlayer`
  Creates an instance of an `AudioPlayer` that doesn't release automatically.

  > **info** For most use cases you should use the [`useAudioPlayer`](#useaudioplayersource-options) hook instead.
  > See the [Using the `AudioPlayer` directly](#using-the-audioplayer-directly) section for more details.
  | Parameter | Type | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `source` | AudioSource | The audio source to load. |
  | `options` | AudioPlayerOptions | Audio player configuration options. |

#### getRecordingPermissionsAsync (*Function*)
- `getRecordingPermissionsAsync(): Promise<PermissionResponse>`
  Checks the current status of recording permissions without requesting them.

  This function returns the current permission status for microphone access
  without triggering a permission request dialog. Use this to check permissions
  before deciding whether to call `requestRecordingPermissionsAsync()`.
  Returns: A Promise that resolves to a `PermissionResponse` object containing the current permission status.
  Example:
  ```tsx
  import { getRecordingPermissionsAsync, requestRecordingPermissionsAsync } from 'expo-audio';

  const ensureRecordingPermissions = async () => {
    const { status } = await getRecordingPermissionsAsync();

    if (status !== 'granted') {
      // Permission not granted, request it
      const { granted } = await requestRecordingPermissionsAsync();
      return granted;
    }

    return true; // Already granted
  };
  ```

#### requestRecordingPermissionsAsync (*Function*)
- `requestRecordingPermissionsAsync(): Promise<PermissionResponse>`
  Requests permission to record audio from the microphone.

  This function prompts the user for microphone access permission, which is required
  for audio recording functionality. On iOS, this will show the system permission dialog.
  On Android, this requests the `RECORD_AUDIO` permission.
  Returns: A Promise that resolves to a `PermissionResponse` object containing the permission status.
  Example:
  ```tsx
  import { requestRecordingPermissionsAsync } from 'expo-audio';

  const checkPermissions = async () => {
    const { status, granted } = await requestRecordingPermissionsAsync();

    if (granted) {
      console.log('Recording permission granted');
    } else {
      console.log('Recording permission denied:', status);
    }
  };
  ```

#### setAudioModeAsync (*Function*)
- `setAudioModeAsync(mode: Partial<AudioMode>): Promise<void>`
  Configures the global audio behavior and session settings.

  This function allows you to control how your app's audio interacts with other apps,
  background playback behavior, audio routing, and interruption handling.
  | Parameter | Type | Description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `mode` | Partial<AudioMode> | Partial audio mode configuration object. Only specified properties will be updated. |
